         We just mentioned that object contain data, and code to manipulate that data. The entire
        set of data and code of an object can be made a user-defined data type with the help of
        a class. In fact, objects are variables of the type class.
         Once a class has been defined, we can create any number of objects belonging to that
        class. Each object is associated with the data of type class with which they are created.
         For example, any builder wants to build so many bungalows then they ask architect to
        make a blueprint of the bungalow, so that blueprint is like a class. And when houses are
        constructed, each house/bungalow can be considered as object.
         In the above example, blueprint is not going to occupy land similarly classes never
        occupies memory. When bungalows are constructed, they are going to occupy land
        same way when objects are created of type class, it occupies memory.
         Classes are user-defined types and behave like the build-in types of programming
        language.
        Data Abstraction and Encapsulation
         The wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit (called class) is known as
        encapsulation. Data encapsulation is the most striking feature of a class.
         The data is not accessible to the outside world, and only those functions which are
        wrapped in the class can access it.
         These functions provide the interface between the object’s data and the program.
         This insulation of the data from direct access by the program is called data hiding or
        information hiding.
         Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including the
        background details or explanations. Classes use the concept of abstraction and are
        defined as a list of abstract attributes such as size, weight and cost, and functions to
        operate on these attributes.
         They encapsulate all the essential properties of the objects that are to be created.
         The attributes are sometimes called data members because they hold information. The
        functions that operate on these data are known as methods or member functions.
        Inheritance
         Inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of objects
        of another class.
         It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. For example, the bird `robin’ is a
        part of the class `flying bird’ which is again a part of the class `bird’.
        4
         The principle behind this sort of division is that each derived class shares common
        characteristics with the class from which it is derived.
         In OOP, the concept of inheritance provides the idea of reusability. This means that we
        can add additional features to an existing class without modifying it. This is possible
        by deriving a new class from existing one. The new class will have the combined
        features of both the classes.
         Here, the class which inherits another class is called derived class or child class whereas
        the class getting inherited by another class is called base class or parent class.</p>
