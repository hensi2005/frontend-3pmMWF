     We just mentioned that object contain data, and code to manipulate that data. The entire
    set of data and code of an object can be made a user-defined data type with the help of
    a class. In fact, objects are variables of the type class.
     Once a class has been defined, we can create any number of objects belonging to that
    class. Each object is associated with the data of type class with which they are created.
     For example, any builder wants to build so many bungalows then they ask architect to
    make a blueprint of the bungalow, so that blueprint is like a class. And when houses are
    constructed, each house/bungalow can be considered as object.
     In the above example, blueprint is not going to occupy land similarly classes never
    occupies memory. When bungalows are constructed, they are going to occupy land
    same way when objects are created of type class, it occupies memory.
     Classes are user-defined types and behave like the build-in types of programming
