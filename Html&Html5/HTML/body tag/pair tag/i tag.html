 Programming problem is analyzed in terms of objects and the nature of communication
between them. Program objects should be chosen such that they match closely with the
real-world objects.
 Object take up space in the memory and have an associated address like a structure in
C.
 When a program is executed, the objects interact by sending message to one another.
For example, if “customer” and <b><i>“account” are two objects in a program,</i></b> then the
customer object may send a message to the account object requesting for the bank
balance.
 Each object contains data, and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without
having to know details of each other’s data or code
