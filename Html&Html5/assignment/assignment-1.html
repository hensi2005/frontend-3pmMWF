    <h1>basic introduction of HTML</h1>
    <p>We just mentioned that object contain data, and code to manipulate that data. The entire
        set of data and code of an object can be made a user-defined data type with the help of
        a class. In fact, objects are variables of the type class.</p>

       <p> In the above example, blueprint is not going to occupy land similarly classes never
        occupies memory. When bungalows are constructed, they are going to occupy land
        same way when objects are created of type class, it occupies memory.</p>
